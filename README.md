# Day 1: Basic RAG System

## What I Built
A basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using:
- LangChain for orchestration
- OpenAI GPT-4 for language generation
- ChromaDB for vector storage
- Python for implementation

## Key Components
1. Document Loader - Loads text/PDF files
2. Text Splitter - Chunks documents into smaller pieces
3. Embeddings - Converts text to vectors
4. Vector Store - Stores and retrieves similar documents
5. LLM - Generates answers based on retrieved context

## What I Learned
- How to set up a Python development environment
- Virtual environment management
- LangChain framework basics
- Vector databases and embeddings
- Basic RAG architecture

## Challenges Faced
- PowerShell execution policies
- LangChain package structure changes
- Import compatibility issues

## Next Steps
Day 2: Compare vector databases and advanced chunking strategies
