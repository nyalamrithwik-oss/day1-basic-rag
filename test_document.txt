This is a test document about RAG systems.

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation.

It helps AI systems answer questions by retrieving relevant 
information from a knowledge base.

The main components are:
1. Document loading - Reading PDFs, text files, etc.
2. Text chunking - Breaking documents into smaller pieces
3. Vector embeddings - Converting text to numerical vectors
4. Semantic search - Finding relevant chunks based on meaning
5. LLM generation - Using AI to generate natural responses

RAG systems are used for:
- Customer support chatbots
- Internal knowledge bases
- Document question-answering
- Research assistants

Key benefits:
- More accurate than pure LLMs
- Can cite sources
- Updates easily with new documents
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning
